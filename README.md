# Web Scraper

[Repl.it demo here!](https://blog-scraping.chrispinkney.repl.run) (Though it only prints to console, see results.csv in this repo for the actual csv file.)

A simple web scraper built while learning Python during my study break. It scans a preset website and dumps the specified data to a CSV file. This was the project that truly displayed the beauty of Python to me.

## Technology
The web scraper uses Python in conjunction with the Beautiful Soup, CSV, and Requests library. The documentation for beautiful soup was particularly informative.
